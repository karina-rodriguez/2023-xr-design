Established in UX design, user-centered method support 
developing systems with users requirements at heart.

![User centered design process &copy; Whale Design - stock.adobe.com](fig/AdobeStock_424127018.jpeg){alt="centred design"}

Supports digital experience design, engagement and enables deep users insight.

Promotes accessibility, inclusivity and democratisation.

Facilitates vision development, strategic thinking of systems which will be built.

### Forms of user segmentation

- Demographic
- Psychographic
- Behavioural
- Geographic

Example segmentation tools: [Office of National Statistics Profiles - Census 2021](https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/customprofiles/draw/)

## Challenge: Find the characteristics relevant to your application


Explore an area of Brighton
where you think users can make use of your intended
XR system.

Explore the type of user they are using the
profile tool from [National Statistics](Office of National Statistics Profiles),
imagine how much disposable income have and what 
type of activities they like doing.

Stakeholders who wish to keep involved
Audiences: UX personas
Archetypical CH audiences
Empathetic design thinking

Key points to examine:
Personal information
Professional information
Goals
Values
Communication and media
Frustrations
What is digital experience design
interconnected with User Experience (UX)
captures the user’s journey when interacting with a system, service or product
refers to thinking, planning, proposing a digital product
affects audiences’ perceptions and responses via this product
aims at designing an experiential framework for meaningful experiences

Digital experience design aspects:
How the experience feels, what are its components
How the the experience is formulated through prototyping and testing
Entire view of the experience development  (e.g. design, usability, function, desirability)


The five W’s (and one H)  of digital experience design
Who: who is the user (audiences)?

What: what will the users do? what is their task/s?

Where: where will the users live the experience (physical environment, conditions, other users and more)?

When: when will the users perform the task (at home, in the exhibition?)

Why: why do users perform the tasks (purpose, goal)?

How: how will they perform the tasks?
Digital experience design developments
Involves interdisciplinary teams

Moves towards less authoritative approaches (audience/user centered instead of GLAM centered)

Iterative way to manage digital experiences (non-linear)

Embraces more voices, i.e. community collaboration

Moves out of the GLAM’s door and becomes participatory and experimental, (intangible documentation, field work, community decisions/content)

Becomes more critical and tackles global challenges


Digital experience design in CH: disciplines

Museum curation/exhibition design

Product design

Software development/User experience (UX) design

Teams often include: curators, researchers/subject specialists, designers, ICT departments, graphic designers, communities, and more
Digital experience design processes: curation/exhibition design 
Digital experience design processes: product design 
Framework for Innovation (2019)

Discover: Understand, rather than simply assume the problem spending time with people

Define: From the discovery phase helps to define the challenge

Develop: Encourages people to give different answers to the problem, seeking inspiration and by co-designing

Deliver: Involves testing different solutions at small-scale, rejecting and/or improving others

Digital experience design processes: product design 
Systemic Design Framework (2021)

Design elements:
Orientation and vision setting
Leadership and storytelling
Connections and relationships
Continuing the journey

Design processes:
Explore
Reframe
Create
Catalyse


Digital experience design processes: UX design 
Digital experience design processes: commonalities
Digital experience design processes: design thinking
Design thinking (1950-)

User-centered approach

Brings together people from the initial stages of development

Good to define the ‘problem’ (exploratory)

Good for innovative design

Focus on how useful the product is to the user

Can be combined with other processes/methodologies

Digital experience design processes: methodologies
Digital experience design approach: Co-design
Users become active collaborators

It is a participatory practice in CH

Focus on iterative, user centered activities and decisions

Empowerment, ownership, democratisation

In the digital spectrum in involves users throughout the design process

More appropriate for user-centered methodologies (e.g. Agile, Lean)
Digital experience design processes: methods
Appreciative enquiry

Field walks

Brainstorming

Interviews

Focus groups

Digital experience design processes: methods
Personas

Narrative scenarios

Bodystorming

Card metaphors/card sorting

Task analysis



Digital experience design processes: methods
Low fidelity prototyping

Sketching in hardware

Qualitative usability testing

Benchmark testing

Accessibility evaluation (WCAG 2.1/2.2)


Digital experience design processes: methods
Interviews

Focus groups

Observations

Surveys

Log analysis

Digital experience design: considerations
Digital experience design: MVP/MMP/MLP versions
Interactive multimedia experiences in CH
Can be classified under different criteria (e.g. purpose/function, audience, media, device, location, involvement of senses)
GLAMs testbeds for digital, hence great variety of applications

Some examples:
Online collection explorations: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History – Human evolution 
Online storytelling exhibits: Google Arts & Culture – Wood carving Craft, Brighton & Hove Museums – A short rife in a log walk
Journey makers: Art Institute Chicago – Journey maker
Virtual tours: Sir John Soane’s Museum – Virtual tour, Vizcaya Museum and Gardens – Virtual tour
Interactions with holograms: Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Centre – Survivor Stories Experience
VR/AR applications: Iron Age funerary urn from Saltdean, Sussex, CHESS AR stories at the Acropolis Museum
Audio tours: Ashmolean Museum Oxford – Rebellious Bodies
Educational applications/games: Science Museum – Total darkness, American Museum of Natural History – Ology
Creative activities: V&A – Make & Do: Stitch and sew
Well-being activities: National Gallery - Van Gogh's 'Wheatfield, with Cypresses’ 5 minute meditation
Podcasts: Tate podcasts
Smart replicas/exhibitions: Smart replicas, Allard Pierson Museum - Smart exhibition 'Schijnbeweging'
